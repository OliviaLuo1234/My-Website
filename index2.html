    <p style="color:rgb(250, 169, 211)">Rabbits are cute animals with floppy ears. Many people keep bunnies as pets because they're gentle and fun. They need a good diet of hay and vegetables. In the wild, they dig big burrows to live in. Even though they're shy, rabbits can be playful and love their owners.</p>
