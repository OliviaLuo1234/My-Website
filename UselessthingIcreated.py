#I want to go home
#I am tired
#I want to sleep
#This is kind of boring
#I want to hack roblox
#This class feels like it's two thousand hours
#I bet this class is longer than a century
#Why is it only 3:50 PM 8/23/2023
#It should be 3:50 PM 9/30/1832345678965432345664657476839872938642365293
#Why is time so slow 
#Acually, I don't want to go home anymore
#I could stay here for 12345678973648235486236493748962847562548571926486792 years!
#But I bet that a few seconds after I say that class will be over
#:( sad face
#Never mind I want to go home
#I want to go home and sleep
#Is class supposed to last for 725381538252735268273971647234562346526974682357456345256868682345346576586584573464678345488474 years???
#Next thing on my search history is how to fall asleep in class without getting caught 

#8/24/2023
#Ok so, I'm here again...
#To be honest, python isn't that boring...
#But like some guy in this class likes Kitkats BETTER than SOUR PATCH?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
#Like that's crazy
#Oh my gosh I just thought of that time when I was in class and Jay caught me picking my nose...
#It was so embarissing that now I can't even spell anymore!
#Bro...NOTHING MAKES SENSE
#Well, atleast we can all agree that math doesn't make sense!
#Like, you don't need math to build a spaceship! JUST USE YOUR EYES TO MEASURE
#And You don't need math to invent a spaceship!!
#Just take a tub of gas and pour it in a gigantic metal thig!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#School doesn't teach everything...
#School doesn't teach you how to pay taxes!
#School doesn't teach you how to go to the supermarket and not be awkward
#AND SCHOOL DOESNT TEACH YOU HOW TO MAKE FREINDS
#SCHOOL DOESN'T TEACH YOU HOW TO BUY A HOUSE
#SCHOOL DOESN'T TEACH YOU HOW TO MAKE OUT
#Ok that one was a little innapropriate
#Bro has to say that you will get a sour patch every time for someone to answer a question
#How did I get into such a bad/annoying/spoiled class in 4th grade?? Like I'm not that annoying
#Ok it's mainly the boys thta are annoying but the teacher is like uGh YoU gUyS aRe So AnNoYiNg
#But like WHY DO YOU HAVE TO PUNISH THE WHOLE CLASS
#(Maybe that's why it's so satisfactory for me when I see the boys getting punished...)
#Bruh rock paper sissors is not even that fun anymore
#Like it's so boring that whenever I play that with my friends I always do Rickroll or Uno Reverse Card
#Sponges have holes.......
#Idk what that was supposed to lead to....
#UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I WANNA GO HOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
#I take back what I said earlier: "To be honest, python isn't that boring..." let's just say that earlier I was capping...
#I feel like I have been typing to this computer for about an hour already.....
#NOTHING MAKES SENSE ANYMORE
#WHY IS THE BEST PIZZA IN NEW YORK BUT ITALY CREATED IT????
#WHY ARE SWEATERS CALLED SWEATERS?? ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU SWEAT??
#ok I think they are called that cuz the creator wanted to exaggerate how warm it is...
#Remember when I said this yesterday: 
#"Next thing on my search history is how to fall asleep in class without getting caught" 
#Well I acually searched it up and I think I will try it someday

#8/25/2023
#Hi I'm stuck here for 234657823726487523459236469 hours again
#Honestly now I think Python is the most boring class ever
#Even more boing than Web Development
#Scratch isn't even coding...
#ITS JUST PUTTING TOGETHER RANDOM BLOCKS AND THEN IT DOES SOMETHING
#LIKE THATS NOT CODING THATS BUILDING LEGOS
#I'm tired
#I WANT TO GO HOME
#WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY DID I THINK THIS WOULD BE FUN
#EVEN BEING A STUDENT IS FUNNER THAN BEING A TA
#ALL YOU DO IS JUST SIT AROUND IN THE BACK AND LISTEN TO WHATEVER NONESENSE IS GOING ON
#nope
#nobody does
#we learned something
#well not me at least
#why is sour patch called sour patch???
#ohh yes kahoot

#8/28/2023
#I have to do web development now...
#I miss being a t a 
#soooo boringggggggggggg
#python is better cuz i get to watch youtube
#honestly today I have nothing to say cuz its monday
#and monday sucks
#like the weekdays take 1000000000000 years and like the weekend is 2 seconds
#and the school year is 52376125381276391827408748264519745179457126479215r792791264917259 years
#But the summer break is 3 seconds
#five more seconds and then school starts
#how sad... :(
#but still i cant belive im alive right now like in a person's life 75% pain and 25% enjoyment...
#the 75% is school and work
#but for some people its 100% pain
#why am i even writing comments fro each day I survive in this class??
#(cuz i want to)
#but youre the one who has to answer that question
#wth am i even doing
